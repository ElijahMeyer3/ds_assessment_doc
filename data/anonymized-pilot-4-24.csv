While the FiveThirtyEight study may depict a correlation-- eating more bananas is associated with scoring higher on the SAT verbal than math, no part of the study (as stated) indicates any evidence that the eating of bananas was the reason for the increase in verbal to math score. The individuals who ate bananas and scored higher on the verbal may have scored higher for many reasons, and there is nothing that indicates it was because of the bananas. However, the article suggests that bananas were the cause of the SAT score increase (encouraging the bananas, which implies that they will help), which is in violation of the logic I have explained above.

The curves of these 6 states almost entirely mimic each other. Similarly, in pretty much every southern stat, cases started high in January, leveled off completely, and then spiked in the summer towards the end of the summer, before coming down a little bit. Overall, bordering states tend to have almost identical patterns, and the entire region as a whole tends to follow a pattern.","We cannot definitively conclude this. This graph shows the 14 day rolling average of cases at various points in time, but we do not have the total raw case numbers that we can compare between these two states; every mark is relative to the 14 prior days, and we don't have data aggregated over the whole period. Moreover, since these two graphs do not share the same x-axis, it is difficult to come up with a read on a comparison of the general trend between the two graphs. Lastly, this graph normalizes the case counts to be per 100,000 people, essentially accounting for disparities in population. But when looking at total overall number of COVID cases, as the question asks, population is not normalized, and so this graph does not assist with that question.

This process involves several key steps. First, any currency symbols present in the ""gross"" column are removed to standardize the format. Then, commas serving as thousands separators are eliminated to ensure numeric compatibility. Missing values are addressed through appropriate imputation or removal strategies. Next, all values are standardized to a single currency, typically USD, by converting multiple currencies using exchange rates. Data normalization may also be applied to ensure uniformity in scale. Following data transformation, validation procedures are conducted to ensure consistency and accuracy, including comparison with external sources when available. Finally, the cleaned values are stored in the ""gross_clean"" column, with thorough documentation of the cleaning process for reproducibility and transparency purposes. Through this meticulous approach, the ""gross_clean"" column is generated, facilitating reliable analysis and modeling tasks.

Firstly, such a rule could indirectly discriminate based on age, since there's a strong correlation between age and years of experience. Older candidates are more likely to have over 20 years of experience, so despite not directly using age as a factor, the rule could disproportionately affect older applicants, which could be viewed as a form of age discrimination.

Moreover, the assumption that candidates with more experience will have higher salary expectations might be generally true but is not universally applicable. Some individuals might be seeking a career change, re-entering the workforce after a break, or moving to a region or industry with different compensation norms. Automatically excluding these individuals could mean missing out on potentially valuable employees who may bring a wealth of knowledge and experience.

From an ethical standpoint, it's important to ensure that employment opportunities are accessible based on merit and relevant qualifications rather than assumptions about a demographic group","The title ""Eat more bananas to score higher on the SAT verbal section"" is misleading because it implies causation from a study that likely only showed correlation. The p-value indicates there is a statistically significant association between eating bananas and higher scores on the SAT verbal section. However, this doesn't mean that eating bananas causes one to score higher. There could be many other variables at play that weren't accounted for in the study. For instance, it's possible that people who eat bananas also engage in other healthy habits that contribute to their cognitive performance.

Moreover, the study's design as described doesn't seem to control for other factors that could influence SAT scores, such as education level, reading habits, or socio-economic status. Without controlling for these and potentially other confounding variables, it's not possible to establish a causal link between banana consumption and SAT performance.","The South displayed consistently elevated curves, signaling more substantial outbreaks over this timeframe.
