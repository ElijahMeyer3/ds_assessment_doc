So if the storm doesn't take that path or it takes a slightly different path from that, it could miss city b. City A is in close proximity to many projected storm paths, so although it isn't directly on a path, it is more likely to be in the path of the actual storm that will likely be somewhere in the densest area of the projected paths.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">City a</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">City A is more likely to be hit by the storm path. While city B has a single potential storm path running straight through it, this is the only one out of 50 simulations that comes close to city B. While city A does not have any predicted storm paths crossing directly over it, it is surrounded by multiple potential paths that come within its vicinity. Assuming there is some unpredictability in storm paths and discrepancy between predicted path and real path, it is reasonable to assume that one of the many paths around A may slightly move and hit the city.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">City A is in the center of many of the predicted storm paths, whereas City B is only predicted to be hit by one path. The chances that the storm takes the only path that will hit City B is lower than the chances that City A is in the path.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">City a</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">I think that City A is more likely to be hit because there are many more potential paths that the storm may take which are close to City A. Even though one path that the storm may take cuts right through City B, it is very unlikely that the storm will actually take this path. It is much more likely for the storm to take one of the many paths near City A than the one path through City B.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">The reason I believe city a is more likely to be hit by storm is because more of the storm paths, out of the 50 calculated, are intended to go through or by city a. Only 1 is supposed to go through city b, while it is projected to go directly through it, unlike any of the storm paths near city a, there is less of a chance that the storm will pass city b.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">City a has more lines that pass relatively close to it, in comparison to city b that only has a couple of paths nearby. While city b has a path that lies directly on its location, I still believe by probability that city a is more likely because models always have some sort of error associated with them, so the accumulation of error with all of the paths near it make it more likely that the storm will follow a path that will hit city a in comparison to city b.</td>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: You are working on a team that is making a deterministic model to quickly screen through applications for a new position at the company. Based on employment laws, your model may not include variables such as age, race, and gender, which could be potentially discriminatory.</p>
<p>Your colleague suggests including a rule that eliminates candidates with more than 20 years of previous work experience, because they may have high salary expectations. Are there ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates?</p>
<p>Explain your answer.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Using "years of previous work experience" to exclude candidates with over 20 years of experience may raise concerns about age discrimination and fairness in hiring. This approach could disadvantage older individuals and limit diversity in the applicant pool. It's important for employers to focus on job-related qualifications and avoid practices that could lead to discrimination while hiring.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">By eliminating candidates with more than 20 years of experience, they may be excluding people who are typically older, and thus would be discriminatory based on age.</td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">By eliminating candidates with more than 20 years of work experience, the model would rule out plenty of qualified candidates for the position based on an assumption rather than an objective fact. There are plenty of reasons that the assumption may be untrue - applicants who are minorities in this field may have much lower salary expectations than our colleague's idea of a "high salary," both because they have had a harder time moving up in the field and because they are underpaid when compared to others at the same level. Aside from the fact that training this model on an assumption is unethical, it will also perpetuate the same biased and inequitable systems that are causing these problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">By using work experience as a variable to select candidates there are some ethical issues. A person is more likely to be older if they were to have 20 years of experience in one particular field. Therefore, one could say that the variables are discriminatory towards age due to the fact that only older people would be affected by this rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Candidates who may have 20 years of previous work experience may be applying to a new type of company or field for the first time. It is thus unfair to discriminate against these individuals because they may be more qualified than applicants with less work experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Candidates with more work experience should not be ethically eliminated just because they worked for longer times. They also will not necessarily have higher salary expectations. Theses are assumptions arbitrarily made.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Eliminating candidates with more than 20 years of experience is a covert way of discriminating against older people (ageism). This model has unethical consequences if it discriminates as quick scans may leave room for unintentional discrimination</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Eliminating candidates with more than 20 years of experience may discriminate against older people. People who've worked for 20 years are always somewhat older and eliminating them may inflate the opinions of the younger employees.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">I believe that the model would miss out on experience and leadership.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">I believe that the suggestion to eliminate candidates with over 20 years of work experience raises ethical concerns. To elaborate, implementing such a rule could disproportionately affect older candidates who have accrued extensive work experience, which could lead to age discrimination; this violates both employment laws and principles of fairness.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">I believe there are ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates. This can discriminate against people of older age, as it eliminates people with more work experience. This would lead to a lot of problems within the company as a whole.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">I do think there are ethical implications with eliminating candidates with more than 20 years of previous work experience. For one, these will be more knowledgable than those with fewer years. Furthermore, having a diverse time within the company (including different ages) is important. The fact that one has high expectations for a salary is not a reason to eliminate candidates.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">I personally think there are ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates. Candidates with more than 20 years of previous work experience are often older candidates. This model can implicate age and be potentially discriminatory. Additionally, not all candidates with many years of experience have high salary expectations, so it may not be accurate. Instead, they could use a rule eliminating candidates with a particularly high salary expectation listed on their application, since this is a more direct measure of what my colleague wants.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">I think so because you would technically be penalizing potentially older candidates or people who just have more experience within the field in general. This screening method also implies that people with fewer than 20 years of work experience won't expect as much pay which is a bit tricky as that might make employers less inclined to pay candidates more.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">I think some considerations that they should take into account would include that they are making the assumption the candidate may want a higher salary, when they may not. Additionally, the more experience someone has, the older they will tend to be. Thus, this does not abide by employment laws as they are still selecting the younger candidates by using this rule. Lastly, this criteria is rather arbitrary and will prove to further perpetuate unfair bias and discrimination within the organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">I think there are because work experience, especially 20 years of it, is intrinsically tied to age. Making assumptions about a group's salary expectations based on age is naturally discriminatory.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">I think there'd still inherently be age discrimination in this filter. By definition, someone with more than 20 years of previous work experience should be at least ~35 years old, and so you eliminate many members of that pool without eliminating any members of the younger-than-35 pool. There is still inherent ageism in this prompt, and so there are negative ethical implications for using it.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">I would say yes. This variable may as well be directly correlated with age, which is a potentially discriminatory variable. A lot of people who may be filtered out by this, simply would be too young to have 20 years of previous work experience even if they are qualified for the position.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">If the company believes a certain level of experience is necessary to complete the job effectively, then it is ethical to use that as a variable to select candidates. However, in this case selecting candidates with a certain number of years of experience is not about their ability to do the job effectively, but is about wanting to pay lower salaries. This is unethical and could lead to taking advantage of younger applicants while also discriminating against older applicants, a form of agism.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Indeed, employing "more than 20 years of previous work experience" as a selection criterion has ethical ramifications. Even if it could make sense to pass over candidates with a lot of experience in order to control wage expectations, doing so might unfairly disadvantage senior candidates who have a wealth of knowledge and experience to contribute. This approach could support ageism and promote the notion that older workers are more expensive or less flexible, which is contrary to the values of equity and equal opportunity.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">It assumes that people with more than 20 years of work experience have high salary expectations, when this may very well not be the case. It eliminates people based on an assumption of their personal thoughts. Just because someone may have high salary expectations does not mean they are less qualified for the job, and they should still be considered for the position.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">It implies a certain character for a mere number of work experience, which may not accurately depict the applicant's true holistic character.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">It is vague whether or not the work experience the person's colleagues are talking about is in the specific field of the company they work for. However, it feels as though this variable is limiting to individuals and takes an assumption to be true for all individuals with 20 years of work experience and is therefore unethical</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">It's an implicit form of age-ism by eliminating those who have a longer work experience amount (thus are older).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">No - it all depends with the goals of the company / team.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">No, I do not believe so because the colleague is talking about work experience, which may not be directly related to age. A 40-year-old can have 20 years of experience, and a 35-year-old can also have 20 years of experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">No, I think it is not ethical as certain age groups are being eliminated from the case study therefore not representing the entire population.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">No, as it is just another variables in the process that should be openly given when applying. Years of experience is a completely valid question to ask and does not pertain to anything surrounding other concrete and proven discriminatory variables.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">No, it is a fair reason to not include someone to screen through applications. This does not directly relate to age although it does target those who are older more frequently than someone who is young. There are cases in which someone with 20 years of experience is 45 years old but another 45 year old hire only has 5. Experience is a fair metric to judge someone</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">No, there are no ethical implications of using this variable, since it is not a discriminatory factor like race or gender would be. The company can choose not to hire candidates with over 20 years who may be overqualified and ask for higher salaries; that is their own prerogative, and since it is not any kind of discrimination.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">One ethical implication of using this rule is that it inadvertently can discriminate against older people. This is because people with more than 20 years of experience will be considerably older than people who are just entering the field.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">One ethical implication of using this variable to select candidates is the case of seniority. Dependent on the overall goal of the job position (whether or not the intentions of the job is to provide new experiences to those who lack it), discriminating based on experience raises ethical concerns over practices of age discrimination as well. I believe discriminating based on age and ability, rather than picking the best fit offers ethical concerns over priorities and age discrimination.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Overall, I think their are some ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates. It's hard to imply this throughout this model because they may have experience in this field</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Potentially discriminatory towards older applicants who have had more time to have work experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Some ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates is that it could unintentionally discriminate against age. It is likely that older people have more years of work experience compared to younger people. This could affect the candidate pool that passes through the model and make the model have a bias towards younger candidates.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Someone with more than 20 years of previous work experience is probably 30+ years of age, so there is a potential for age discrimination since older workers are excluded. In addition, you are also missing out on qualified candidates in the hopes of saving money, which is not ethical.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">The answer is Yes, there are ethical implications of using this variable. Even though the model does not explicitly use age as a variable, the use of the "years of experience" variable could be indirectly selecting against older candidates, since they are more likely to have over 20 years of experience. This could still raise ethical implicating of indirect discriminating based on age.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">The ethical implications of this is that your company will discriminate based on age as older people are more likely to have 20 years of work experience. It also may discriminate against those who had to work a job to support their family for longer (for example someone who started working at age 12 to help out their family would be ineligible by age 32)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">The ethical implications of using this variable is excluding a group with work experience which could indicate potential discriminatory towards age and expertise in the field.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">The ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates are numerous. First, refusing to hire candidates with more than 20 years of previous work experience is a form of age discrimination that will overwhelmingly affect applicants of older ages. Secondly, the deterministic model can introduce algorithmic bias to the hiring process. The model will then make assumptions about older applicants' motivations and capacity to work, leading to discriminatory practices. These practices could also potentially violate anti-discriminatory laws.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">The implications of using this variable to select candidates is unethical, as the people with over 20 years of experience are largely composed of older individuals. Thus, this policy is poorly disguised inclusion of age as a variable in employment laws.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are because it is directly correlated with age which is outlawed to be used because it is unethical.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical and legal implications as this could inadvertently lead to age discrimination. By leaving out a specific age group from consideration, because more than 20 years of work experience will correlate positively with older age, will lead to an unfair consideration of younger candidates.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical concerns considering that a person with 20 years of pervious work experierence is older than 20 years old (potentially older than 35). Therefore, this rule would promote ageism and discriminating against older workers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications because agism may be involved generalizing that older people demand more money.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications behind using this variable to select candidates because eliminating candidates with more than 20 years of work experience means that the model is not considering any of the candidates that are older in age. Even though the colleague wants to eliminate them due to them possibly demanding a high salary, this would be discriminatory because it's a variable that considers age and violates employment laws.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications for using this variable to select candidates because this screening may discriminate against older individuals who have just worked longer years without looking a valuable skills and and knowledge that they may contribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications of using this variable since some could argue that this experience potentially causes an age discrimination since older people tend to have more work experiences. Other ethical concerns are socioeconomic bias (some who need to take on work experience at an earlier point of their lives to support themselves and their families are disadvantaged) and decrease in diversity and inclusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates. By eliminating candidates with more than 20 years of previous work experience, the model would include variables of age and potentially gender (e.g., due to maternity leave).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates. It excludes a segment of a population that may be very well qualified for the job and have a strong need for the work. Having more than 20 years previous work experience is also indicative of being an older age, so using this variable has similar ethical considerations to using age. Furthermore, workers with 20+ years experience applying for this position may be willing to work for a lower salary, and it is unfair to eliminate them from the applicant pool without giving them a chance to explain their salary expectations. A better solution may be to have the applicants indicate salary expectations on the application.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates. It is not fair or accurate to assume that someone with more than 20 years of work experience would have a higher salary expectation. You don't know what their previous job was or how much they made. By using this variable, very qualified and deserving candidates could unfairly get eliminated.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates. This discriminates on the basis of age despite it not being explicitly stated because only older members of society would have more than 20 years of previous work experience. This is an unethical form of discrimination particularly when older people might bring nuanced perspectives into the workplace and are an important part of workplace diversity. The notion people with more work experience may have higher salary expectations could be true in certain circumstances but should not be treated as a rule for all people in this category.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates. While this model does not directly use age as a variable, this rule could penalize older participants, since more years of experience typically mean you are an older individual. The model could be biased against older individuals and favor younger individuals because of this rule. This would be a form of age discrimination that would be hard to detect but very much illegal.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications to consider when using the number of years of previous work experience as a criterion for eliminating candidates. Although eliminating candidates based on age in order to eliminate the expectation for high salaries may seem innocuous, it could disproportionately impact older candidates who have accumulated more years of experience, leading to discrimination on the basis of age. Furthermore, you could neglect qualified candidates who have acquired invaluable skills through diverse avenues. Thus, it's important to carefully consider the potential biases and implications of discrimination.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are ethical implications, as someone with 20 years or more of experience will probably be older than most of the other candidates, and by excluding people with +20 years of experience, you could potentially be discriminating against older candidates.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are implications of this. By implementing this rule, you are discriminating a group of people off an assumption, without considering the applicant in further detail.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are indeed ethical implications in using a rule that eliminates candidates with more than 20 years of previous work experience. Firstly, such a rule could indirectly discriminate based on age, since there's a strong correlation between age and years of experience. Older candidates are more likely to have over 20 years of experience, so despite not directly using age as a factor, the rule could disproportionately affect older applicants, which could be viewed as a form of age discrimination. Moreover, the assumption that candidates with more experience will have higher salary expectations might be generally true but is not universally applicable. Some individuals might be seeking a career change, re-entering the workforce after a break, or moving to a region or industry with different compensation norms. Automatically excluding these individuals could mean missing out on potentially valuable employees who may bring a wealth of knowledge and experience. From an ethical standpoint, it's important to ensure that employment opportunities are accessible based on merit and relevant qualifications rather than assumptions about a demographic group</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are not strong ethical implications, there may be a correlation between age and having 20 years of experience, but ultimately work experience is not an uncontrollable factor, and a 40 year old could have 20 years of experience just like an 80 year old.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are potential ethical implications of using this variable, as it disregards other factors that may have contributed to why a candidate may or may not have had 20 years of previous work experience. While there are may be a correlation between work experience and salary expectations, this may not necessarily be an exact causation. For example, candidates with less work experience may be in more need of a higher salary due to socioeconomic status, and may be expecting a high salary as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are potential ethical implications with eliminating candidates with over 20 years of previous work experience, since this would bias the algorithm against older candidates. Older candidates would be more likely to have more work experience. Thus, this could lead to ageism, an extremely prominent issue in today's society.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are some ethical implications of using this variable to select candidates, because years of previous work experience is correlated with age. Older employees don't necessarily have more years work experience, but individuals with many years of work experience are definitely older in age. Thus, eliminating candidates with many years of work experience simply because the firm doesn't want to pay its employees high salaries is unethical.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There are the same ethical implications as before, the parameter of 'more than 20 years of previous work' is essentially reworded/rebranded ageism that points towards ones age given the amount of experience they would have.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There is absolutely ethical implications of using this variable, as candidates with more than 20 year previous work experience are more likely to be older, and therefore discriminating based on work experience is discriminating based on age, which is against employment laws.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">There is indeed ethical implications of using such a variable to select candidates because it introduces bias in the system, especially against those who have a greater work experience which could lead to discrimination against older workers based on their age (since those with greater experience are those who must be older to receive such experience). This practice raises concerns related to age discrimination, which is illegal under the employment laws. It violates the principle of fairness and equal opportunity in employment, as it unfairly disadvantages individuals based on a protected characteristic (age). Furthermore, excluding candidates based on years of work experience may not accurately assess their qualifications, skills, or potential contributions to the company. It overlooks the diversity of experiences and perspectives that older candidates may bring to the workplace, which can be valuable assets to the organization. Instead of relying on arbitrary criteria like years of work experience, it's important to focus on evaluating candidates based on their qualifications, skills, and abilities relevant to the job. Implementing fair and unbiased selection processes ensures equal opportunities for all candidates, promotes diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and aligns with ethical principles of non-discrimination and fairness.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">There is the possibility of discriminating against age as those who have more work experience are typically older than those who are early in their career. Additionally, this variable might eliminate people who are actually much better for the job than others.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">There may not be any strong ethical implications of using this variable because it is simply based on the company's needs and the fact that they may not be able to reach high salary expectations. However, it may not be right to assume that everyone with more than 20 years of previous work experience will automatically have a high salary expectation and therefore, they may miss out on highly qualified candidates who had many years of experience but no salary expectations because of this assumption. Also, by using a cutoff of 20 years, they may be indirectly discriminating against older candidates because older workers are more likely to have had more years of previous work experience.

Therefore, this mechanism is effectively discriminating by age which the team agreed not to do. Additionally, while I'm not sure of the exact statistics, it is quite possible that white men (for example) are more likely to maintain a job for a long period of time, which makes it more likely that white men qualify past the 20 year threshold.

By excluding candidates with extensive work experience, you're potentially missing out on the valuable perspectives and knowledge they can bring to our company.

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Data scientists at FiveThirtyEight administered a food frequency questionnaire. With 54 complete responses they found that people who ate bananas tended to score higher on the SAT verbal section than the SAT math section (<span class="math inline">\(p-value =0.0073\)</span>). An article reporting the results of this study has the headline, “Eat more bananas to score higher on the SAT verbal section”.</p>

Although they found a correlation between those who ate bananas and those who scored higher on the SAT verbal section than math section, there may not be conclusive evidence to establish causation.

<td style="text-align: left;">Correlation vs. Causation. The title misleads you to believe that eating bananas causes one to get a higher score when in reality they are just correlated. There is likely another variable that contributes stronger to the dependent variable than bananas as evidenced by the p value.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">First off, this is misleading because we are measuring a trend. If one eats bananas, they are not automatically destined to score better on the SAT. By including a p value, we measured a linear regression model that places a line of best fit, meaning the headline is not end all be all. Additionally, only 54 people were measured. As we know, we all react differently to food and outside environments due to our complex genes, so this is another reason why it isn't completely true and more studies need to be done to make this conclusion.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">First, it states that bananas are the cure for the SAT verbal section, which they aren't. This test has a lot of other variables that could change these results. It's a small sample.

<td style="text-align: left;">First, the title may be confusing a corelative finding in the study with causation.

<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">For one, the correlation found between the study says nothing of who scores higher in general, but rather that the banana eaters tended to score higher on the verbal section relative to THEIR OWN math section.

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">I believe there are many parts of the study that could lead to incorrect and misleading conclusions, one of which is sample size and their title. For example, while a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant, the population surveyed could offer insight into the overall statistical correlation, it cannot lead you to make the affirm conclusion that "Eating More Bannanas will lead to a Higher Score." There could also be other variables, such as households who are able to eat a banana every day are also higher income and can access more resources.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">It is misleading because the study found a correlation between eating bananas and getting higher verbal scores than math scores, but the headline implies causation. There was also a pretty small sample size, so to make definitive claims, a larger data set is necessary. The study also ignores many other variables that could affect scores, like study habits and educational background. Finally, the study found a correlation between eating bananas and getting higher verbal scores than math scores, but it doesn't mean the verbal scores were good, just that they were higher than that individual's math scores. There could be a student who scored almost perfect on the verbal scores, but if they had a perfect math score, they wouldn't fall into this category.</td>

There is a correlation between the two variables, but correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation.

It could be a number of reasons that this is the case: people who have more of an affinity for english sections tend to eat bananas more, eating bananas reduces your math section score, or people who eat bananas aren't eating something else that is holding back their verbal section score. You can't say definitively that people who ate bananas score higher from an observational study that is not even studying the exact question that is at hand.</td>

Additionally, the sample size of 54 respondents is relatively small for drawing broad conclusions about the general population.

<p><strong>Question</strong>: The visualization below displays the 14-day rolling average of new COVID-19 cases January 1 - August 31, 2021 in the United States. Each plot represents a state or Washington, D.C., and is labeled using the state’s abbreviation (e.g., MA = Massachusetts). The shaded area under each curve represents the increase in new cases since the state’s minimum point in 2021. This is a recreation of a similar plot that originally appeared in the New York Times.</p>

The curves of these 6 states almost entirely mimic each other. Similarly, in pretty much every southern stat, cases started high in January, leveled off completely, and then spiked in the summer towards the end of the summer, before coming down a little bit.

<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we can learn about the regional and state-level trends of the 14-day average of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people between January to August in 2021. Most of the states in the South, West, and North Central shows a spike of cases towards the end of period, around July and August. However, states in the Northeast are not as affected by the cases and maintain a steady decreasing trend throughout the visualized period (January 1 to August 31). On average, the South experienced the most pronounced sudden increase in cases towards the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we can learn that COVID-19 cases have varied across different states in the U.S. from January to August 2021. The shaded areas represent the relative increases from each state's minimum case count during this period, with some states showing significant increases while others remain relatively flat. The color coding also suggests regional trends, indicating that certain regions may have experienced similar trajectories in case numbers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we can learn that the number of COVID cases in the US varied throughout the time period depending on the region the state was located in. Generally speaking, the cases worsened in the latter months of the study in the Southern states and the Western states, but in the Northern Central and Northeast, the numbers were a lot more contained and steady.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we can learn which states are having the most increase or decrease in COVID-19 cases. Also a general look at the plot can help determine whether COVID-19 cases in the US are going up or down. It seems like most states are decreasing in COVID-19 cases but are not at a minimum-- they have mostly all increased COVID-19 cases since their minimum point in 2021. States in the South specifically seem to have recent increases in COVID-19 cases.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we can see that larger increases in COVID-19 cases in the later months occurred more often in the southern states such as LA, MS, and FL. Also, for most of the states, we see a downward trend in COVID-19 cases during the start of 2021 and then a slight increase closer to August. However, states in the Northeast tended to follow a downward trend all throughout January-August with a slight bump in between the two months.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we can see that most southern states experienced an increase in COVID cases near the end of this time period (roughly in July/August of 2021). Most northeast states experienced fairly low and generally slightly decreasing over time COVID case rates during this time period. Most west and north central states experienced fairly low case rates and then a slight increase towards the end of the time period.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we can see that southern states have spiked in new cases since their 2021 low points, given their prominent shaded regions. States in the northeast tend to be trending down with only minor spikes since their lows. The North Central and West regions appear to be more of a mixed bag, with some states spiking more than others. As a whole, this plot tells us about general trends in cases across each state, as well as the size of their most recent spike since a low point.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we learn that different regions in the United States had very different COVID case trends during the study period. For example, the South tended to see high spikes in cases around this time period, while those effects were much more muted in the Northeast.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we learn that regions in the South experienced a large increase in COVID cases later on, as the right halves of the graphs show high densities / areas. For states in the Northeast, the plots show that the increase in number of COVID cases decreased over time. Lastly, the North Central and Western states have similar trends: first a decrease and then an increase in the number of COVID cases after 2021.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we learn that the southern states had the greatest increases in new cases since the state's minimum point in 2021. We also learn that the 14 day average of new covid cases of many of the US states spiked around June/July/August.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">From this plot, we learned that states in the South Region have on average seen a greater increase in Covid-19 cases since the state's minimum point in 2021 in comparison to any other region (especially in the last few days) whereas states in the west have only seen a slight increase. States in the northeast have on average seen lower Covid-19 cases and states in the North Central have seen approximately the same in Covid-19 cases.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Generally, COVID-19 cases increased in America towards the end of the period from January to August, suggesting that COVID was becoming more common during this time. This effect is greatest in the Southern states, since they show the greatest increases from their minimum points. Additionally, this effect seems to be minimal in the Northeastern states.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Honestly, I find this plot extremely confusing and difficult to decipher. That said, I believe that the shading of this plot shows that states in the South experienced a greater degree of increase in new cases since the state's minimum point in 2021 compared to states in the other listed regions. States in the Northeast appear to have experienced the the smallest increase in new cases since the respective state's minimum point in 2021 compared to the other regions listed.</td>

The West and North Central appear to have similar new cases of COVID, with the West having slightly more new cases (specifically in Alaska). There are a multitude of reasons for this, whether that be a lack of following CDC guidelines are a lack of vaccines in certain regions.</td>

So, it appears that there was a notable difference in the overall number of COVID-19 cases in August 2021.

Lastly, this graph normalizes the case counts to be per 100,000 people, essentially accounting for disparities in population. But when looking at total overall number of COVID cases, as the question asks, population is not normalized, and so this graph does not assist with that question.

While rate of women remembering more than men was higher than the rate of fearing more than men, we don't know anything about the ratio of women remembering to women fearing. 10:1 is a better ratio than 30:10.</td>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="image-recognition">Image recognition</h2>
<p>A data science student wants to create an image recognition algorithm to identify whether a university professor belongs to a department in the sciences or not. To do this, she collects data by scraping several university photo archives of university faculty. She labels faculty in the photos as “Sciences” or “Not sciences”. The images below depict a small representative sample of her data.</p>
<p><img src="images/image.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: The data science student plans to use these photos of current university faculty to predict whether they are scientists. What concerns might you have about the predictions from this algorithm?</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">1) All the photos are of old-time faculty and may not be representative of modern data, 2) all photos in sciences are older White-presenting men in lab coats while all photos in non-science contain either women, minorities, or a non-lab environment - this can lead to potential sexism/racism in the results (using as diagnostic criteria to get incorrect answers). Additionally, it could incorrectly use the prescence of a lab coat as a diagnostic criteria</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">1. these photos are very old, and there is a small sample size that does not accurately represent the population. 2. given the look, date, and location of these images, it is likely that white men will be overwhelmingly associated with "sciences" while women and minorities wont. I dont believe these photos accurately represent modern society</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">A concern I have is that a lot of the people, especially in the science pictures, are men. This may create a bias in the algorithm that predicts that men are more likely to be scientists than women. Another concern is that the sciences shown are all sciences that mostly take place in a lab, which limits the type of scientists that the algorithm will identify.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">All of the images are very old and in black and white so it may be difficult to extrapolate them to current faculty. In addition a model trained on old photographs may not do a good job at predicting current, modern faculties. The model may be very likely to pick up on background information such as lab coats, microscopes, maps, etc.-- however these may not extrapolate to modern fields (scientists who do not use items that were associated with scientists in the past, and non-scientists that do). There are also ethical concerns with basing a model on the likelihood of one being a scientist of appearance, race, and gender, as it essentially is trying to determine what a scientist "should" look like, even though one can be a scientist regardless of their demographic considerations. In addition, there are not that many images here, and so if a model that is supposed to predict the entire duke faculty's status is built off of these few images, an image that has a lot going on (big lab coats, many people huddled around, etc.) may have an inorbitantly large influence on the output.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">All of the photos from the sciences group are of white people, mostly men, in lab coats or working in labs. The not science photos, however, are more diverse and show possible scientists not in a lab or lab coat, which not all scientists always are.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">All of these photos are in black and white, which would leave the AI unable to distinguish between contemporary photographs of scientists that are generally in color. There is also a lack of accounting for a change in trends in the science field, such as changed clothing trends, increased diversity and new lab tools.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">All of these photos seem very old which has ethical implications if she uses it as her data. Most likely in the time that these photos were taken, there were fewer minorities in the sciences (this is also visible in the photos above). For this reason, it will most likely predict that these minorities are not scientists.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">All the scientists represented in the pictures are white men. Thus, an algorithm will inherently have a bias towards predicting that white men are scientists. People who do not fit this characteristic will be more often predicted as not scientists.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">An issue could be diversity; the people in the sciences pictures are mostly old white men with no coloured people and a few women, while the non sciences pictures have a black man and women, which could lead the algorithm to become unknowingly racist and misogynistic, predicting that coloured people or women don't belong in the sciences.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">As many image recognition algorithms identify based on the data set it was "trained" with, the data set or university provided by the students shows scientists that are primarily white and male. This means that most male, white professors that are identified by the algorithm will be considered scientists, while female and colored professors won't be.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">As the images of university faculty in the science departments mostly involve physics or chemistry lab materials in the background with white lab coats, the algorithm might be relying on these background information to predict and the predictions might not be as accurate when these features are removed. It might also reinforce such stereotypes on scientists. Moreover, some university faculties could change departments or have interdisciplinary roles in both sciences and not sciences departments. This is not captured this binary labeled algorithm. Also, the images are all old black and white images with much an much older historical context, and so the algorithm might not work on current university faculties, since the historical context has changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">As you can see in the "sciences" sample, there are only white individuals. No other races are represented in this sample, while in the "not sciences" sample, there is one black man. This may create a racially-biased image recognition model because it will likely predict all black individuals to be "not sciences" which is not accurate. There are also no people of other races, resulting in poor classification given images with people of other races. In addition, this model may also be gender-biased. Out of all the individuals in the "sciences" category, there are 12 men and 7 women. Out of all the individuals in the "not sciences" category, there seems to be more of an equal number. These training data fed with unequal numbers of race and gender will result in a biased algorithm.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">At first glance, I noticed that the sciences prediction has mostly white men pictured. While the not sciences includes women and people of color. I am concerned that this is the wrong display of whether or not someone is predicted to be a scientist and is discriminatory.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Based on very antiquated values. There will be a man bias. Not all scientists wear suits.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Because of gender-based and racial discrimination within academia, more white men are shown as a part of the sciences professors and more women and people of color are in the non science images. If these images are used to build this algorithm, they will contain the same biases when making predictions.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Bias based on race and gender of scientists historically in the photos</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Biases in the algorithim. The system will most likely sort women and those of color in the not sciences pile because that is the outdated and most common biases if the algorithm has learned off of a wide range of data.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">By training an algorithm on historical data, the algorithm will train the program with the historical conditions embedded in its creation. So, it could be likely that women and racial minorities are underrepresented, so it would be more likely to label white, male individuals as a professor in one category or another.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Concerns I might have about the predictions from this algorithm is that they may be racially and gender biased because the sample images reflect similar races and gender in each category and not enough diversity across the two because the data was only scrapped form one source.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Concerns for using this algorithm is that the photos for the sciences do not include people of color, diversity, or many women. So, using this algorithm to predict whether or not current faculty are scientists would be heavily skewed towards white men.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Current photos of university faculty are in color while these archival photos are in black and white. The algorithm might struggle predicting with colored photos because its training data was on black and white photos. Additionally, there is not a lot of skin tone variation in the photos. The one individual with darker skin ton is in "not sciences," which could lead to the program thinking that all individuals with darker skintones are not scientists.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Every image has multiple professors and are in different environments which might lead to very low confidence predictions as there are too many variables to keep track of.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">This is similar to the Amazon hiring selection criteria -- the data set that this student is running his algorithm from is overwhelmingly white and male.

<td style="text-align: left;">This model could discriminate against people.

For example, March could be identified in a variable called winter_to_spring. The if statements would be as such (in pseudocode): if month is in the vector with all the winter_to_spring; if day is after the start day of season, its in spring, otherwise its in winter.

<p>The table below provides data about 10 movies released in the United States. It provides data on the movie’s title (title), the movie’s director (director), the date the movie was released (release_date), the season the movie was released (season), the worldwide gross intake in U.S. dollars (gross), the cleaned version of the worldwide gross intake in U.S. dollars (gross_clean), and whether or not the movie won the Best Picture Oscar (best_picture).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: You have been tasked with adding a new column called nominated_for_best_picture which indicates whether or not each movie was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar (“Yes” if it was, “No” if it was not). Is there sufficient information in this dataset to generate this new column? Explain.</p>

<td style="text-align: left;">Based on the dataset above, there is not sufficient information to create the new column nominated_for_best_picture. The dataset currently includes a column best_picture that indicates whether or not each movie won the Best Picture Oscar. However, being nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and winning it are two different things. So, as seen every year in Hollywood, a movie could be nominated for the award but not win it, and this dataset does not provide information on nominations that did not result in a win.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">No, there is not sufficient information in the dataset provided to generate the new column "nominated_for_best_picture" indicating whether each movie was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar.

<td style="text-align: left;">I do not believe there is sufficient information in this dataset to generate this new column because although it is clear that movies with values of "Yes" under the "best_picture" column were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, we cannot determine whether the movies with values of "No" under the "best_picture" column were or were not nominated for the Best Picture Oscar.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">I do not have enough context to accurately determine the answer. If it is a known fact that only nominated movies wins the best picture oscar award, then we could mutate to create a new column based off some condition for best_picture. If we do it this way we would generate a lot of N/a's, especially for the movies that did not win the best picture oscar award. It the case above is not a known fact, it would be unreasonable to create a new column full of N/As.</td>

The Start_with pseudocode is equivalent to specifying the movies table as the data frame at the start of the pipeline. Keeping the rows where the season value is fall would then mean using the filter function to only display the films that were released in the fall. To count the rows where the best picture value is yes, we would add an additional filter argument stating that the best picture value is "Yes." Lastly, we would then use the count function to give us the number of rows in the output that fit these criteria.</td>
